webgl-3d-animation
==================

A node.js app giving you an interactive 3D animation using WebGL showing a 2D predator prey ecology on a grid which is real-time mapped onto the surface of a 3D torus.  node.js server side gives access to WAV format files which are rendered using Web Audio API - this is an exercise where I taught myself how to display data for an ongoing project on sound synthesis


# Installation

Visit [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) and install Node.js. 

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:scottstensland/webgl-3d-animation.git
```

Change directory into the project folder:
```bash
cd webgl-3d-animation
```

Then install the dependent modules:

```bash
npm install
```


Launch the nodejs app:

```bash
npm start
```


Using a WebGL savvy browser, point it at URL :

```bash
		 http://localhost:8888 
```

or ignore above and just see this WebGL app deployed live on heroku :

   instructions on how to drive this ...

    run on a computer not on a phone since it currently uses
   just the mouse and keyboard as controls

     mouse left button and middle scroll wheel
           page up / page down
     arrow keys  left/right/up/down
           also these keys :  w s a d


      it uses WebGL for graphics
    I wrote it in the language javascript infact that was my
      "Hello World"  for both javascript and WebGL

       hit the button :    "Play jam looped" 
        so it plays a tune which I then visualize both
         in time domain as well as frequency domain
