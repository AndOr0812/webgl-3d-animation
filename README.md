webgl-3d-animation
==================

A node.js app giving you an interactive 3D animation using WebGL showing a 2D predator prey ecology on a grid which is real-time mapped onto the surface of a 3D torus.  node.js server side gives access to WAV format files which are rendered using Web Audio API - this is an exercise where I taught myself how to display data for an ongoing project on sound synthesis
